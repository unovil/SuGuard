# SuGuard Application

## Introduction

This is the repository for the SuGuard application as part of our research project at Pasig City
Science High School. It is an Android application that aims to help users manage their SuGuard
wristband and see their history, while having the option to download their data for further
analysis by medical professionals in the event of a medical emergency.

We, the researchers, hope that this tool will be used in conjunction with the wristband to
bring the world into a safer place by notifying people early about possible health risks through
continuous monitoring of their blood glucose, hemoglobin, and blood oxygen levels.

## Installation

As of now, the application is not yet available on the Google Play Store and is still a
half-baked product. However, you can contribute to our cause by cloning this repository and
helping us fix bugs and add more features.

### Prerequisites

In the installation process, the app requires the user's phone to have the following:
- A minimum Android SDK of 23 (Android 6.0 aka Marshmallow)

### Installation Steps

Just download from the application from the repository and install it on your phone. You may
need to enable installation from unknown sources in your phone's settings. After that, you can
use the application.
